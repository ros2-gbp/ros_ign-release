  * Port NavSat (#224 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/224>) from ROS 1 to ROS 2 (#268 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/268>)
    Co-authored-by: Tyler Howell <mailto:76003804+TyHowellWork@users.noreply.github.com>
  * Add ParamVec and bridge from Ignition (#261 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/261>)
    * Introduces ros_ign_interfaces::msg::ParamVec for storing a list of Parameters that are int, bool, double, or string.
    * Introduces bridge for ignition::msgs::param to ros_ign_interfaces::msg::ParamVec
    * Introduces bridge for ignition::msgs::param_v to ros_ign_interfaces::msg::ParamVec
  * Add support for converting Any <-> ParamValue (#260 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/260>)
    * Add support for converting Any <-> ParamValue

  * Add node component and yaml-configured bridge node (#238 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/238>)
    * Refactor in support of adding yaml-configured node
  * Add rssi to Dataframe.msg (#249 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/249>)
    * Adding rssi field to ros_ign_interfaces/Dataframe.msg
  * Use the python generator for tests as well (#234 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/234>)
    * Use the python generator for tests as well
  * Generate boilerplate files from Python scripts (#233 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/233>)
    The way that we add factories can be a bit error-prone, as there are a lot of strings that cannot be checked at compilation time. This changes several of the boilerplate files to be generated automatically by python scripts, in line with how ros1_bridge does it.
  * [galactic] Backport GuiCamera, StringVec, TrackVisual, VideoRecord (#241 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/241>)
    * [ros_ign_interfaces] Add more interface definitions.
    * Add conversion functions for the added messages
    * Update the factory factory function with the new messages
    * Add new messages to docs
    * Add test cases for the new messages conversions
    Co-authored-by: Ivan Santiago Paunovic <mailto:ivanpauno@ekumenlabs.com>
  * Add Dataframe message and bridging (#239 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/239>)
  * Factory interface needs virtual destructor (#232 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/232>)
  * Optional "lazy" bridge subscribers (#225 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/225>)
    This allows for the bridge to be created in such a way that it is "lazy". In this case "lazy" means:
    * The publication (output) side of the bridge is always on and actively looking for subscriptions.
    * The subscription (input) side of the bridge is only turned on in the case that there are subscriptions on the output side.
