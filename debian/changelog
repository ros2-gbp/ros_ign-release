  * feat: override_timestamps_with_wall_time parameter (backport #562 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/562>) (#584 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/584>)

  * Use memcpy instead of std::copy when bridging images (#565 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/565>) (#585 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/585>)
    While testing ros <-> gz communication using the bridge I noticed that the bridge was talking quite a bit of time copying images from Gazebo to ROS. I found that the std::copy operation that we're doing is substantially slower than the memcpy alternative. I think that in principle this shouldn't happen but the numbers are quite clear. Perhaps std::copy is doing something that doesn't use cache effectively
