    The RosGzBridge and GzServer now support different spellings for
    boolean arguments (True, true). This also simplifies how
    conditionals are used to create composable nodes by evaluating the
    conditionals and using them as regular Python booleans instead of
    relying on PythonExpression. It was actually the PythonExpression
    that was preventing support of boolean arguments spelled true/false.
  * Improve parameter handling for RosGzBridge
  * Fix linter errors
  * Improve argument parsing in Actions

  * Use memcpy instead of std::copy when bridging images (#565 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz//issues/565>)
    While testing ros <-> gz communication using the bridge I noticed that the bridge was talking quite a bit of time copying images from Gazebo to ROS. I found that the std::copy operation that we're doing is substantially slower than the memcpy alternative. I think that in principle this shouldn't happen but the numbers are quite clear. Perhaps std::copy is doing something that doesn't use cache effectively
