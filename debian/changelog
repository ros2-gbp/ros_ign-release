    This PR fixes an incorrect subscription on one of the demos. Running
    ```
    ros2 launch ros_gz_sim_demos gpu_lidar_bridge.launch.py
    ```
    causes rviz2 to crash and exit with the error:
    ```
    rviz2-3]
    [rviz2-3] >>> [rcutils|error_handling.c:108] rcutils_set_error_state()
    [rviz2-3] This error state is being overwritten:
    [rviz2-3]
    [rviz2-3]   'create_subscription() called for existing topic name rt/lidar with incompatible type sensor_msgs::msg::dds\_::PointCloud2\_, at ./src/subscription.cpp:146, at ./src/rcl/subscription.c:108'
    [rviz2-3]
    [rviz2-3] with this new error message:
    [rviz2-3]
    [rviz2-3]   'invalid allocator, at ./src/rcl/subscription.c:218'
    [rviz2-3]
    [rviz2-3] rcutils_reset_error() should be called after error handling to avoid this.
    ```
    This is due to an incorrect subscription on the part of the demo. This
    PR fixes it by getting a subscription to the right topic for the
    pointcloud display. (lidar/points instead of lidar). Was tested on
    garden + humble.
