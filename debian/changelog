  * Fix linter errors
  * Improve argument parsing in Actions
    The RosGzBridge and GzServer now support different spellings for
    boolean arguments (True, true). This also simplifies how
    conditionals are used to create composable nodes by evaluating the
    conditionals and using them as regular Python booleans instead of
    relying on PythonExpression. It was actually the PythonExpression
    that was preventing support of boolean arguments spelled true/false.

ros-jazzy-ros-gz-sim (1.0.7-1noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Bugfix: if "false" is always True (#617 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/617>) (#640 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/640>)
    There is an issue in this launch file when passing the string 'false' as
    an argument. In Python, non-empty strings are always evaluated as True,
    regardless of their content. This means that even if you pass 'false',
    the system will still evaluate it as True.
    This bug results in the launch system incorrectly calling the OnShutdown
    method twice. When any ROS launch action invokes a RosAdapter, it
    triggers the following exception: "Cannot shutdown a ROS adapter that is
    not running."
    To temporarily work around this issue, you can launch gz_sim_launch.py
    with the on_exit_shutdown argument set to an empty string. This prevents
    the erroneous shutdown sequence and avoids the associated exception.

  * Add topic flag to create robot  (#128 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/128>)
    Now it is possible to run ros_gz_sim create specifying a topic as
    source of the robot description
    Add a launch file starting a ignition gazebo world and spawn a sphere in it.
    Additionally a rviz2 interface is loaded to show that also Rviz can load
    the robot description
    The newly created demo introduce a dependency on the robot_state_publisher package

    - This allows use of gz_sim.launch.py with custom gazebo plugins
