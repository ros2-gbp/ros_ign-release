  * Support <gazebo_ros> in package.xml exports (#492 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/492>)
    This copies the implementation from gazebo_ros_paths.py to provide a
    way for packages to set resource paths from package.xml.
    ```
    e.g.  <export>
    <gazebo_ros gazebo_model_path="${prefix}/models"/>
    <gazebo_ros gazebo_media_path="${prefix}/models"/>
    </export>
    ```
    The value of gazebo_model_path and gazebo_media_path is appended to GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH
    The value of plugin_path appended to GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH

    Now it is possible to run ros_gz_sim create specifying a topic as
    source of the robot description
    Add a launch file starting a ignition gazebo world and spawn a sphere in it.
    Additionally a rviz2 interface is loaded to show that also Rviz can load
    the robot description
    The newly created demo introduce a dependency on the robot_state_publisher package
  * Add default value for plugin path in launch script (#125 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/125>)
  * Fix overwriting of plugin path in launch script (#122 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/122>)
